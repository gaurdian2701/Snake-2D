# Snake-2D
Repository for my Implementation of classic Snake in Unity

- This contains Single Player and Co-Op mode.
- The snake has to eat red apples for mass gain and green apples for mass burn.
- There are three power ups: Shield Invincibility, Speed Boost, and Score Multiplier.
- Use WASD or Arrow Keys to move.
- If the snake eats itself/loses all bodies then game over.
